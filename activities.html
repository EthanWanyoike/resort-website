    <h1>Radiant Island Resort</h1>
    <h2>Your #1 Holiday Resort!</h2>

  <p>Few people will want to spend an entire holiday sunbathing and swimming, so we have program of excursions and activities for our guests.</p>
  <p>Activities available for our guests include:
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Day trips</strong> - Day trips are one of the very few ways you’ll be able to see something of the 'real' Maldives occupied by ordinary Maldivians. This is a good way to see otherwise inaccessible islands.</li>
      <li><strong>Fishing</strong> - Our customers get to do sunset, sunrise or night-fishing trips. We can also arrange big-game fishing trips. Large boats, fully equipped with radar technology, are used to catch dorado, tuna, marlin, barracuda and jackfish among others.</li>
      <li><strong>Snorkelling & Diving</strong> - our resort caters for divers and snorkellers, and most organise twice-daily diving excursions and sometimes snorkelling trips too. Dive schools are generally of an exceptionally high safety standard, as regulated by Maldivian laws.</li>
      <li><strong>Spa Treatments</strong> - As a destination that has become synonymous with relaxation, our Maldivian resort unsurprisingly offers a huge array of treatments in purpose-built spas. These include many different types of massage, beauty treatments, Ayurvedic (Indian herbal) medicine, acupuncture and even traditional Maldivian treatments.</li>
      <li><strong>Surfing</strong> - Our resort is very popular with surfers. With surfer arrivals going up, we are located near 3 good breaks. For those wishing to avoid the crowds and explore a pristine region of the country we offer an option to join a ‘surfari’.</li>
    </ul>
